### Other notes

Files helper.js, viewmodel.js, and style.css have been uglified/minified using Grunt.

When parsing my code, you'll find that there are a few blocks of code commented out entirely - This is because I plan on expanding the app in the future and those commented bits are pieces of functions that will be used later.
